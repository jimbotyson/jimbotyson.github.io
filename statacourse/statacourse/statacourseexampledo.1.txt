#check that all remaining variable values are in range
#I'm going to illustrate this with a loop - it's a learning opportunity!
#first generate a flag variable that will indicate if any values are
#suspicious: all zeroes to start with
#we are going to use the very useful *capture* will allow us to ignore
#an error caused in case rangeflag already exists
#if rangeflag exists, then the gen statement is ignored:

capture gen rangeflag=0

#now the loop which applies the inrange function
#(with a ! for *not*) to each of fincp fhincp

foreach var in fincp fhincp {
	replace rangeflag= 1 if !inrange(`var',0,1000000)
}

#produce a report on any out of range values

list serialno fhincp fincp if rangeflag == 1

#drop cases with out of range data
#of course, this will not always be the right thing to do

drop if rangeflag==1

#create derived variables

gen avinc = (fincp + fhincp)/2

gen mobtech = 1 if(flaptopp == 1 & ffibreopp ==1)

#rankings - creating some ordinal values from existing continuous variables

#how would you do this?

#create some basic plots and summaries

#what would be required for these?
